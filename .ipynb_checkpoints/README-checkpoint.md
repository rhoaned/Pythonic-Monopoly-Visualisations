# Pythonic-Monopoly-Visualisations
Our company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard, and he needs your help. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the Toronto market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.

## Notebooks
### Rental Analysis
This notebook you will find all the Rental Analysis carried out based on the Toronto data.

### Dwelling Types Per Year
This section, calculations of the number of dwelling types per year and visualized the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function.

### Average Monthly Shelter Costs in Toronto Per Year
visualising the average monthly shelter costs per year to understand rental income trends over time. The average (mean) shelter cost for owned and rented dwellings per year has been visualized with multiple line charts.

### Average House Value per Year
The average house value per year has been determined based on the analysis in this section. An investor may want to understand better the sales price of the rental property over time. For example, a customer will want to know if they should expect an increase or decrease in the property value over time so they can determine how long to hold the rental property.

### Average Prices By Neighbourhood
Comparative Analysis is used to compare average prices by neighbourhoods in Toronto

### Number of Dwelling Types per Year
Visualisation of the number of dwelling types per year in each neighbourhood. There is a tool provided for investors to understand the evolution of dwelling types over the years.

### Top 10 Most Expensive Neighbourhoods
Data for the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods are collected and graphed. The mean house value for each neighbourhood is calculated, followed by sorting the values to obtain the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods on average. Results are plotted as a bar chart.

### Neighbourhood Map
Using neighbourhood location data an interactive map with the average prices per neighbourhood is then generated with mapbox. Then we used a scatter Mapbox object from Plotly express to create the visualization with the help of Mapbox API key.

### Cost Analysis
Plotly express offers a broad selection of interactive plots. In this section, using Plotly express investors can interactively filter and explore various factors related to the house value of Toronto's neighbourhoods.

### Dashboard
Again, using the Panel library an interactive dashboard is built for all of the visualizations.
